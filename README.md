# Customer-Segmentation-using-Kmeans-clustering-

- Overview
This repository contains the code and data for performing customer segmentation using KMeans clustering. Customer segmentation is a powerful technique that allows businesses to divide their customer base into distinct groups based on similar attributes. KMeans clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for this purpose.

- Prerequisites :
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook (for running the included notebooks) or we can run through google collab

- Installation :
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/Greeshmanth19/Customer-Segmentation-using-Kmeans-clustering.git.
Navigate to the project directory: cd Customer-Segmentation-using-Kmeans-clustering.
Install the required Python packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt.

- Usage : 
To perform customer segmentation using KMeans clustering, follow these steps:
Prepare your data: Ensure you have a dataset with relevant customer attributes for segmentation.
Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook K_Means_Clustering.ipynb.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your data and execute the KMeans clustering algorithm.
Analyze the results: Visualize the clustered customer groups and interpret the insights gained.

- Data : 
The dataset used in this project is provided in this repository.
Mall_Customers.csv is the dataset that is used in this project. The dataset contains attributes like CustomerID, Gender,	Age,	Annual Income (k$),	and Spending Score (1-100). out of these attributes we just used Annual Income (k$),	and Spending Score (1-100) for forming clusters.

- Algorithm : 
KMeans clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that aims to partition data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Randomly initialize K cluster centroids.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all points in the cluster.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a specified number of iterations.

- Results :
You can find the results of the customer segmentation in the notebook and explore the visualizations to understand the characteristics of each customer group. Use these insights to tailor marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, or enhance customer experience.
